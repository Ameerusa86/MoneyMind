here is the plan, we will create a github branch for every feature we will implement and then PR after testing.

what I'm currently doing

1. get paid every 2 weeks
2. open up all my Credit cards, loans websites and check my balances and then start paying
3. choose the amount of payments per how much is my balance
4. need to keep tracking on everything, income, expenses, payments due dates etc
